# Sign-In with Ethereum Buttons

https://login.xyz

About: Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary. Already used throughout web3, this is an effort to standardize the method with best practices and to make it easier for web2 services to adopt it.
